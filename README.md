# Intelligent Requirement Elicitation
Project Overview
This project leverages unsupervised learning and large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract software requirements from user reviews of mobile applications. By clustering similar user reviews and summarizing them into structured software requirements, the project aims to reduce redundancy, enhance requirement analysis, and streamline the software development process.
